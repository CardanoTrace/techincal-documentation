# Products

During the process of QR Code creation, the product information will be included as metadata in a transaction which will be registered on Cardano’s Blockchain. Only users with the necessary NFT included in the transaction will be able to submit data relevant to their product. This represents both a “Quality Seal” and an anti-counterfeit measure (please see below in Foreseen challenges).
